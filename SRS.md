# Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and be sure that your group has a `main` branch with this document and the entire [template repository codebase](https://github.com/david-gary/onlineStoreTemplate) either forked or downloaded and copied into your group's repository. If you have arranged to use a different codebase as a template, you do not need to have the original template included, but a `main` branch is still required.

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

 **Rationale** This is a low prioriy because while it is a nice feauture that would push sales on a site, it isn't needed and doesn't change the functionality of the site.
 **Testing:** This requirement could be tested by clicking on items in specific orders/amounts and seeing whether or not they appear on the list.


**ID: req-wishList**
 **Description:** This is a wishlist similar to Amazon, it creates a list of things you want and pushes and email when that thing is on sale/cheaper.

 **Rationale** This is important as an account allows for things like cart and wishlist among other functionalities to work, also fosters customer loyalty.
 **Testing:** You could test by making sure the user is in the database when created.

## Constraints

Ben Jansson constraints: 1) Using HTML for the website, while using html to create the website using a programming language might be better but would take a lot longer. 2) Another constraint might be to figure out what kind of shoe we want to sell mens, womens, kids, sytle, sports etc.

* **Developer Experience:**  When it comes to flask and python I have little experience leading to our vision not being completed exactly the way we want.
* **Version Control:** Version control is very hard for inexperienced github users, this can create issues in our work and delay it.
